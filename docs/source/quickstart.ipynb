    "# Getting started\n",
    "\n",
    "A lot of people get diagnosed with squamous cell carcinoma in the head & neck region ([HNSCC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Head_and_neck_cancer)), which frequently metastasizes via the lymphatic system. We set out to develop a methodology to predict the risk of a new patient having metastases in so-called lymph node levels (LNLs), based on their personal diagnose (e.g. findings from a CT scan) and information of previously diagnosed and treated patients. And that's exactly what this code enables you to do as well.\n",
    "\n",
    "As mentioned, this package is meant to be a relatively simple-to-use frontend. The math is done under the hood and one does not need to worry about it a lot. But let's have a quick look at what we're doing here.\n",
